Given a claim, its metadata, question and evidence pairs (each question can be addressed by several related evidences), your goal is to analyze the claim and how the evidence aligns with it. Then, you must label into one of following:
* Supported: The claim is fully backed by clear, consistent evidence with no significant contradictions.
* Refuted: The claim is directly contradicted by reliable evidence, or there is no evidence to support the claim. 
* Not Enough Evidence: When the evidence is insufficient to either support or refute the claim.
* Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking: The evidence both supports and opposes the claim or is selectively presented to favour the claim.

Guidelines:
* Take note of the date of the claim, the timeline it refers to, its speakers, location, and reporting source for contextualization. Evaluate the evidence within the timeline and geographical scope of the claim.
* Take note of the Trustworthiness and URL titles of the evidences.
* For numerical claims, focus on the data points. For event claims, check timelines and occurrences. For position statements, evaluate the speaker's intent. Again the time-frame is important in all cases.

Here are some examples:

EXAMPLE: 2
Claim: Cloth masks trap carbon dioxide which is a risk to health.
Claim Date: 21-6-2020
Claim Speaker: William Senkarik
Location ISO Code: US
Reporting Source: Facebook
Claim Types: ['Event/Property Claim']
Fact Checking Strategies: ['Consultation']
Queries and Evidence:
Q1: Do face masks trap air?
Q1, A1: Masks are designed to be breathed through and can protect against respiratory droplets, which are typically much larger than tiny carbon dioxide molecules. Consequently, most carbon dioxide molecules will either go through the mask or escape along the mask's loose-fitting perimeter. Some carbon dioxide might collect between the mask and the wearer's face, but not at unsafe levels.
Source for Q1, A1: https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/faqs

Justification: Evidence found suggests that most carbon dioxide molecules either go through the mask or escape along the loose-fitting perimeter, and whilst some carbon dioxide cna collect between the mask and wearers face it doesnt reach unsafe levels so isnt a risk to health, the claim is refuted.
